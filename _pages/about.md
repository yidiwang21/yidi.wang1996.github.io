# About Me
I will join the [Department of Computer Science and Engineering](https://www.scu.edu/engineering/academic-programs/department-of-computer-engineering/) at [Santa Clara University](https://www.scu.edu/) as an Assistant Professor in Sept 2024. I received my Ph.D. in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering from University of California, Riverside in 2023. \
My primary research interests are in the field of real-time embedded and cyber-physical systems. The core objective is to advance the design of responsive, predictable, and verifiable computing systems for tasks with dynamic timing constraints especially in resource limited environments.

# To Work With Me
<span style="color:red">I am looking for a PhD student highly interested in systems research, starting in Fall 2025.</span> Please be prepared to commit 4-5 years of hard work in research, and rewards may take time in this field. \
Master/undergraduate students and summer interns are also welcome. To apply, please drop me an email with your CV and transcripts.
